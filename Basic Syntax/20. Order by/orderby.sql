SELECT * FROM employees 
ORDER BY last_name;

-- The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns.
-- In this case, the result set will be sorted based on the specified column(s).
-- You can sort the results in ascending order (ASC) or descending order (DESC).
-- If no order is specified, the default is ascending order.
-- Example:
-- ORDER BY column1 ASC, column2 DESC;
-- This will sort the results first by column1 in ascending order, and then by column2 in descending order.
